## Architecture Recommendations

### Current Architecture Overview

The current architecture consists of several smart contracts that collectively enable decentralized exchange operations, staking, and governance functionalities. Here's how they work together:
1. **V3FactoryOwner Contract**: This contract serves as the owner of a Uniswap v3 factory, allowing privileged functions to be executed, such as enabling fee amounts, setting protocol fees, and changing the admin address.
2. **UniStaker Contract**: Designed for staking ERC20 governance tokens to earn rewards in another ERC20 token, the UniStaker contract includes features like delegation, reward distribution, and beneficiary designation.
3. **DelegationSurrogate Contract**: This contract holds governance tokens for users and delegates voting power to a specific delegatee. It's commonly used to allow users in a pool to retain governance rights when their tokens are pooled together.
4. **IERC20Delegates Interface**: Represents a subset of an ERC20 token with additional delegation capabilities, allowing for voting power delegation to another address.
5. **INotifiableRewardReceiver Interface**: An interface for notifying a reward receiver when rewards are issued, facilitating communication between the V3FactoryOwner contract and the UniStaker contract.
6. **IUniswapV3FactoryOwnerActions and IUniswapV3PoolOwnerActions Interfaces**: Define actions related to ownership, fee structure, and protocol management within the Uniswap v3 ecosystem.

### Problems with the Current Architecture

1. **Centralization Risks**: The architecture relies on admin-controlled functions, introducing centralization risks if the admin address is compromised or misused.
2. **Upgradeability**: Lack of upgradeability mechanisms in certain contracts could lead to central points of failure or control, hindering the protocol's decentralization.
3. **External Dependencies**: Interactions with external contracts and protocols create dependencies that may be controlled by centralized entities, undermining the decentralization of the protocol.
4. **Complexity and Scalability**: The current architecture involves multiple contracts and interfaces, increasing complexity and potentially hindering scalability and efficiency.

### Architecture Recommendations
