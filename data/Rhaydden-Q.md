## Title
Missing validation of Admin argument could lead to incorrect event
emission

## Impact
Because the `setAdmin` lacks input validation, the admin can be updated to the existing admin. Although such an update wouldnâ€™t change the contract state, it would emit an event falsely indicating the admin had been changed.

## Proof of Concept
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-uniswap-foundation/blob/5298812a129f942555466ebaa6ea9a2af4be0ccc/src/V3FactoryOwner.sol#L110C2-L115C4

```solidity
 function setAdmin(address _newAdmin) external {
    _revertIfNotAdmin();
    if (_newAdmin == address(0)) revert V3FactoryOwner__InvalidAddress();
    emit AdminSet(admin, _newAdmin);
    admin = _newAdmin;
  }
```

## Exploit scenario:
Bob has set up monitoring of the Admin change event to track transfers of the admin role. Alice, the current admin, calls `setAdmin` to update the admin to her address (not actually making a change). Bob is notified that the admin was changed but upon closer inspection discovers it was not.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add a check ensuring that the _newAdmin argument does not equal the existing
admin
