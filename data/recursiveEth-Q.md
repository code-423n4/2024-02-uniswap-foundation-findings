Title: Implementing Admin Modifier for Access Control
Impact:
Implementing an admin modifier would enhance code readability, maintainability, and security by centralizing access control logic. Currently, the _revertIfNotAdmin() function is repeatedly called within several functions to ensure that only the admin can execute certain actions. Consolidating this logic into a modifier would streamline code execution and reduce the risk of overlooking access control checks in individual functions.

Proof of Concept:
The following modifications demonstrate how to implement an admin modifier and refactor existing functions to use it:

solidity
Copy code
modifier onlyAdmin() {
    require(msg.sender == admin, "V3FactoryOwner__Unauthorized");
    _;
}

function setAdmin(address _newAdmin) external onlyAdmin {
    require(_newAdmin != address(0), "V3FactoryOwner__InvalidAddress");
    emit AdminSet(admin, _newAdmin);
    admin = _newAdmin;
}

function setPayoutAmount(uint256 _newPayoutAmount) external onlyAdmin {
    require(_newPayoutAmount != 0, "V3FactoryOwner__InvalidPayoutAmount");
    emit PayoutAmountSet(payoutAmount, _newPayoutAmount);
    payoutAmount = _newPayoutAmount;
}

function enableFeeAmount(uint24 _fee, int24 _tickSpacing) external onlyAdmin {
    FACTORY.enableFeeAmount(_fee, _tickSpacing);
}

function setFeeProtocol(
    IUniswapV3PoolOwnerActions _pool,
    uint8 _feeProtocol0,
    uint8 _feeProtocol1
) external onlyAdmin {
    _pool.setFeeProtocol(_feeProtocol0, _feeProtocol1);
}
Tools Used:
Solidity (programming language for Ethereum smart contracts)
Recommended Mitigation Steps:
Refactor the code to implement an admin modifier as demonstrated in the proof of concept.
