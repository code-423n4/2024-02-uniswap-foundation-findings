#### L1 - No Zero Amount Check in `Unistaker::_stake`

##### Description 
In the `_stake` function, there is currently no check for a zero `_amount`. 
A check should be added at the start of the _stake function to ensure that _amount is greater than 0.

##### Recommendation 
```require(_amount > 0, "Stake amount must be greater than zero");```
#### L2 - No check it deposit exist or zero in `Unistaker::_alterbenificiary`
##### Description 
In the _alterBeneficiary function, there is currently no check for a zero deposit.balance.

##### Recommendation 
A check should be added at the start of the _alterBeneficiary function to ensure that deposit.balance is greater than 0.
`require(deposit.balance > 0, "Deposit balance must be greater than zero");`
#### L3 - V3FactoryOwner Not using TwoStepOwnerShip while updating critical roles 

##### Description

V3FactoryOwner functions such as `setAdmin`  updating admin to new address and it should be done in 2 Step process.

##### Recommendation 

Use OZ `2StepOwnership` library and implement it while setting new admin
#### L4 - Unistaker::claimReward does not return any value 
##### Description 
Function `claimReward` is executing further internal function `_claimReward` which claims earned rewards for `msg.sender` by transferring Reward to beneficiary but it doesn't return any value 
##### Recommendation 
modify the internal function to return rewards claimed by msg.sender
##### L5 - No use of Pausable Functionality 

##### Description 

`Unistaker.sol` crucial staking and withdrawing functions are dealing with distribution and staking of funds in term of rewards but protocol doesn't inherit pausable functionality and doesn't apply pausing functionality on important function to reduce risk incase there is attack on the contract on Mainnet. Without Pausable functionality there would be no way to stop attacker from draining funds incase of exploit

##### Recommendation 
Inherit Pausable Library from `OpenZepplin`.
