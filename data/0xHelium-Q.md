In the referenced lines messages are signed using correct arguments such as depositor, nonces etc... However the signature does not have deadline. This can open door for infinite validity of signatures. 
When a user gets the signature to do something on behalf of another user without time limit , he can save the signature for using it years later when the signature owner have potentially moved to another thing.
Implement a deadline for the signature to ensure they are used within the time limit to avoid such issues.
You can do like this for example:
```solidity
 _revertIfSignatureIsNotValidNow(
      _depositor,
      _hashTypedDataV4(
        keccak256(
          abi.encode(
            ALTER_DELEGATEE_TYPEHASH, _depositId, _newDelegatee, _depositor, _useNonce(_depositor), _deadline // @audit: add deadline.
          )
        )
      ),
      _signature
    );
```
