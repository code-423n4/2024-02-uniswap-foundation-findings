## [QA-1] Lack of Pausable Functionality in Staking Contract
The  staking contract lacks the ability to pause operations. This  can pose a significant risks in the event of attack scenario.Security vulnerabilities might require pausing the contract to prevent users from interacting with it in an unstable state. 

To mitigate these risks, it is recommended to introduce a pausable mechanism into the contract. This can be achieved by leveraging OpenZeppelin's Pausable contract.

## [QA-2] Missing Reward Balance Check in Claim Function

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-uniswap-foundation/blob/5a2761c8277541a24bc551fbd624413b384bea94/src/UniStaker.sol#L740

The `_claimReward` internal function directly attempts to transfer the calculated reward amount to the beneficiary without verifying if the contract's balance of the `REWARD_TOKEN` is sufficient to cover the transfer. In scenarios where the reward contract's balance is insufficient, the transaction will revert due to the failure of the `safeTransfer` call consuming gas without completing the intended action.

Frequent failed transactions due to insufficient balance still consumes gas unfairly penalizing users.

mitigation should be to Proceed with the `safeTransfer` only if the contract has sufficient balance to cover the reward. Otherwise revert the transaction with a descriptive error message.
